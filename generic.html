									<h2> Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<br />

								</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/DikshantKakadiya/Portfolio/blob/java/AES.java" class="image fit"><img src="images/AES.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>In this project, I worked on using the CBC and ECB modes of the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages. To confirm the procedure, a plain text message is transformed into encrypted data before returning to the original message. The code initializes an initialization vector (IV) and a key for encryption. It contains techniques for CBC and ECB mode encryption and decryption and tests these techniques in the primary function. Nevertheless, several portions of the code still need to be improved, such as the part where the encrypted data is transformed into a hexadecimal string and then decrypted using ECB.</p>

								<p>In this project, I have worked on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange procedure; Alice and Bob can create a shared secret key across an unreliable channel. It defines a base alpha, a big prime integer p, and private keys for Bob (key). The computation and printing of the bit count in p are done. Each party calculates the shared secret key using each other's public key and their own private key. The resulting shared keys are prepared with leading zeros, translated to hexadecimal characters, and printed to ensure everyone gets the same shared key.</p>

                                <p>In this project, I worked on verifying if a specific public key signed a PDF file. It contains methods to load a file and a public key from a disk. The check method uses these to load a public key, signature, and PDF file to be verified. It then initializes a Signature object with the public key, updates it with the PDF data, and verifies the signature. The primary method iterates through multiple PDF files and public keys, checking if any combination produces a valid signature and prints the result. This ensures the authenticity of the PDF files by confirming that a known key signed them.</p>

									<h2>Data Encryption Standard (DES)

								<a href="https://github.com/DikshantKakadiya/Portfolio/blob/Python/des%20like.py" class="image fit"><img src="images/des_structure.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>In this project, I worked on implementing a simplified block cipher encryption algorithm. The expand function expands a 6-bit input to 8 bits based on a predefined table. The s1 and s2 functions apply S-box transformations to 4-bit inputs, outputting 3-bit values. The f function combines these steps: expanding input, XORing with a key, and applying S-boxes. The subkey function generates a round-specific subkey from the primary key. The round function processes a 12-bit input, applying the f function and swapping halves. The encrypt function performs multiple rounds (5 in this case) of the round function on the input plaintext using the provided key. The main block tests these functions for correctness.</p>

								<p> In this project, I worked on defining an Encryption class with static methods for a simple encryption and decryption algorithm. The encrypt method takes a 16-bit input and uses a hard-coded key (0x8D5E). It XORs the input with parts of the key in three rounds, swapping key halves each round, and returns the result as two bytes. The decrypt method reverses the process: it combines two bytes into a 16-bit input and swaps key halves and XORs to recover the original input. A hard-coded test ensures the process works as expected, demonstrating the encryption and decryption of a given input.</p>

                                <p>In this project, I worked on defining a custom_cipher function that encrypts a given text using a specific process. It removes whitespace and punctuation, converts the text to lowercase, and then shifts each letter by +4 positions in the alphabet, converting the result to uppercase. It separates the resulting characters into even and odd indexed lists of their ordinal values. The final output is the combined list of these ordinal values, printed in hexadecimal format in five groups. This process transforms the input text into a structured, encrypted form.</p>

                                <p>In this project, I worked on defining an encryption and decryption process based on a custom cipher. The encrypt function removes whitespace and punctuation from the input. It converts it to lowercase, shifts each letter by +4 positions in the alphabet, and groups the characters into even and odd indexed lists of their ordinal values. The decrypt function reverses this process, converting the grouped ordinal values into characters and shifting them back by -4 positions in the alphabet. This implementation demonstrates a simple encryption scheme using basic string manipulation and character ordinal values.</p>

									<h2>RC4 <br />

                                <p>In this project, I worked on implementing the RC4 stream cipher for encryption and decryption. The RC4 technique encrypts the plaintext after generating a random key of the same length. Each character in the plaintext is XORed with a pseudo-random byte produced by RC4 as part of the encryption process, including a critical scheduling method and a pseudo-random generating technique. The ciphertext is the outcome. The original plaintext can be recovered by XORing the ciphertext and decrypting it with the same key. This illustrates the main application of symmetric encryption using the RC4 method. </p>

								<p>In this project, I worked on arranging files in a directory according to their type by transferring them into subfolders. It lists every item after verifying that the designated directory is present. If the "docx" and "pdf" folders don't already exist, it makes two new ones. The files in the directory are then iterated over, and their extensions are checked. Files ending in ".docx" are placed in the "docx files" folder, whereas files ending in ".pdf" are placed in the "pdf files" folder. This script assists in organizing files into distinct directories based on the sorts of files.</p> </p>

								<p>I have computed the user's height in inches and weight in pounds to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI This BMI is then sorted into groups to identify the user's existing weight condition. The groups encompass underweight, average weight, overweight, obese, extreme obesity, and morbid obesity. The script computes their BMI using a specific formula after users enter their name, weight, and height. It then provides an appropriate message to the user based on their present weight status. In this way, our script categorizes someone's BMI quickly and conveniently using their own height and weight measurements.</p>

								<p>I have worked on using BeautifulSoup to scrape a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue. It requests the page content, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and finds the target table within the page. It then extracts the table headers and creates a Pandas DataFrame with those headers. Next, it extracts the table rows, iterates over each row, and extracts the data from each cell. Finally, it appends the extracted row data to the DataFrame. The script displays the final data frame containing the list of the largest companies and their relevant information.</p>

									<h2>Integer Factoring <br />

								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/DikshantKakadiya/Portfolio/blob/Python/Integer%20Factoring.py" class="image fit"><img src="images/factoring.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I have worked on demonstrating a simple method for generating and factorizing composite numbers (n) into their prime factors. It uses the getPrime function from the Crypto. Utilize. The number module generates two random prime numbers (p and q), multiplies them to get n, and then uses the factorize_naive function to find the prime factors of n. The factorize_naive function employs a naive trial division approach to find factors. The script iterates through a range of numbers to generate n and calculates the time taken to factorize it. The output displays the original n, its factorization (p and q), and the time taken for factorization. This illustrates the basic concept of prime factorization and its computation time for different n values. </p>
